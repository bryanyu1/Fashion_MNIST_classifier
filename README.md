# Fashion_MNIST_classifier 

A TensorFlow neural network that classifies fashion items based on their images.

The data is from a course on Degreed by Jerry Kurata. I used Jerry's course as an introduction to neural networks. The Jupyter-Notebook walks through the processing of data and the training/evaluation of multiple neural network (TensorFlow) models. I made edits to the commentary and code to help with my own understanding. 

Please note that I have not been able to run the TensorBoard validation steps. There is a problem with my Mac OS that stops TensorBoard from opening. Furthermore, I have not run the deployment of the trained model as it requires the use of Google Colabs.
